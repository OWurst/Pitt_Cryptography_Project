# Pitt_Cryptography_Project

This repository was our group project for Pitt CS1653, "Cryptography and Network Security". For the project, we built a distributed system with a frontend, auth server, and multiple resource servers. users of the system form groups and share files among each other, and resource servers store files and allow access to group members. Over the course of the semester, our assumptions about the security of the system became less and less reliable, forcing us to take more and more sophisticated security measures. To run the app, see the user's manual in /docs<br>  

The members of the group were: <br>  
Gavin Abramowitz: https://github.com/gavin-abramowitz<br>  
Michael Bartlett: https://github.com/michaelbartlett17<br>  
Luke Charlesworth: https://github.com/lukechar05<br>  
and me, Owen Wurst<br>  
In the end, I was primarily responsible for the Auth server, Gavin and Luke were primarily responsible for building the Resource server, and Michael was primarily responsible for building the client side.
