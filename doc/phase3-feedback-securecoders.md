## Comments

### Documentation and writeup

Writeup wasn't even submitted until a week after the deadline. What happened
here? (I have record of saying, once it was already past the deadline, that you
could make updates to help you prepare for the demo, but nothing about the
writeup.)

I said this during review, and i disagreed with the justification in response:
The figures being at the end as bad for readability. I understand they are
referenced from multiple places, and that *some* flipping will be necessary no
matter what, but putting them in an appendix feels punishing to your reader for
no reason. It's a minor point, but advice i gave in good faith. This is not a
penalty, and perhaps you simply disagree with my position, but i'm reiterating
my experience as a reader in case it is helpful for future work in other courses
(and elsewhere).

Inconsistencies: Are keypairs generated before compilation or at runtime? The
writeup says both.

Are you confident that the token and the session key can always fit within an
RSA-encrypted packet? Why? (Remember RSA size limits and the typical approach to
use hybrid cryptography.)
