## Comments

The T1/T8 part of the threat model is a little difficult to understand. Is the
AS actively malicious? Are we simply protecting against the possibility of the
database being compromised inadvertantly? It would have really helped to
elaborate on what you are saying *could* happen and what *could not* happen, and
why that's realistic to some real-life situations.

Great choice of mechanisms for offline password attacks, i like that you looked
at state-of-the-art in the area.

Very detailed T2/T9.

Good threats and mechanisms overall
